A nonbinary identity and umbrella term for genders that, rather than being defined in relation to male or female, are described by concepts that are often perceived as having no relation to gender. Some xenogender people may describe their gender as being related to objects or animals, sensory experiences, neurodiversity, or other concepts unrelated to male or female.
